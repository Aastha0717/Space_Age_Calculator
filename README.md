# ðŸš€ Space Age Calculator  

Ever wondered how old you'd be on Mars? Or how many birthdays you've missed on Jupiter? This **Space Age Calculator** takes your age in Earth years and tells you your age on other planets based on their orbits around the Sun.  


## ðŸŒŽ How It Works  
Each planet has a different orbital period (time taken to complete one revolution around the Sun). This program calculates your age on different planets using their respective year lengths.  

For example:  
- **Mercury year = 0.24 Earth years** â†’ You'd be **4x older** there!  
- **Jupiter year = 11.86 Earth years** â†’ Youâ€™d be **way younger** there.  


## ðŸ“œ Features  
âœ… Enter your Earth age and get your age on all major planets  
âœ… Works for all ages (unless you're a time traveler ðŸ‘€)  
âœ… Simple, lightweight, and fun to use!
